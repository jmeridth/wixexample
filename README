This is a basic project that has a bat file that will compile, run tests, use sandcastle to generate docs, and zip up everything.

NOTES:

1. There is a dependency of having sandcastle installed and HTML Help Workshop installed. If they are not, the build will tell you where to download them. Goal is to break this dependency.

OPTIMAL GOAL:

1. Move away from NAnt completely and use Rake, the Ruby build tool. It just reads much nicer. That is a little ways down the road, but soon.
