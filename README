NOTES:

1. Requires MSI Installer be installed on what ever box you plan to test deployment on.

2. I run {MsiVal2.exe}[http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/msival2_exe.asp] (including in source lib folder in trunk) against the created MSI to see if we violate any of {Microsoft's Internal Consistency Evaluators(ICE)}[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa369206.aspx]
